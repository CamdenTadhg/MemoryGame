This is my first Javascript project. It is a simple memory game in which you match two pictures of the same species of bird. Where there is sexual dimorphism, for example in a Northern Cardinal, the images will show a male and a female. Where there is no sexual dimorphism, for example in a Blue Jay, the two images will be more similar. 

Features: 
- select from regional picture sets
- select the number of cards to play with
- compete against yourself with low score tracking
